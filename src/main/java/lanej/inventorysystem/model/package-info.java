/**
 * This package primarily provides the classes used to abstract the handling of inventory items within the
 * inventory management software.
 * <p>The `Inventory` class serves as the main point of access for managing the inventory data and provides methods for
 * adding, deleting, and updating products and parts.</p>
 * <p>The `Part` and `Product` classes provide model objects for representing inventory items and have methods for getting
 * and setting properties.</p>
 * <p>The `InHouse` and `Outsourced` classes extend the `Part` class to provide more specific types of parts, with
 * additional properties and methods.</p>
